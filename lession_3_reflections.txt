Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: clones are used to get the same repo from github on my local machine or to clone a repo locally to another repo
A: forks are used to get the repo of someone else in my own github repo. If i use fork i can control the repo as my own repo.
A: branches are used e.g. if i want to create a new feature, test it and later add it to my master branch or to create backups etc.
